Since multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction, it doesn't matter if we remove the parentheses. That's why  \\begin{align*}\n&54+(98\\div14)+(23\\cdot 17)-200-(312\\div 6)\\\\\n&=54+98\\div14+23\\cdot17-200-312\\div 6\\\\\n&=\\boxed{200}.\\end{align*}\n\n\n\n**<font color='green'>Answer:</font>**\n200"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Utilities","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load model directly\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"meta-math/MetaMath-7B-V1.0\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"meta-math/MetaMath-7B-V1.0\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-13T07:01:44.824537Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-13T07:01:44.825005Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"tokenizer_config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/748 [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"41bb02e6bdc04ff3bdb84eb10cca7a04"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"tokenizer.model:   0%|          | 0.00/500k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"29f8a0c24da8468ebaa4f55a074fd649"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"added_tokens.json:   0%|          | 0.00/21.0 [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"90722591da284d829b961efce17954b0"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"special_tokens_map.json:   0%|          | 0.00/96.0 [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"0d2748a147a945d991d4d92241aad523"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/625 [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"2f6c9eeabba94b50b1e5013d7a3c7907"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"pytorch_model.bin.index.json:   0%|          | 0.00/26.8k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"d5749546621d4ff69486df11f9c41da5"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading shards:   0%|          | 0/3 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"a8959c54dbaa4fd782dd89709fedbc5f"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin:   0%|          | 0.00/9.88G [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"4ad5751249c64dff896ef14791b9f47b"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\n\n# Extract answer from model response\ndef get_answer(text):\n    try:\n        answer = re.search(r'Answer:\\s*([\\s\\S]+)', text).group(1).strip()\n        answer = answer.replace(\",\",\"\")\n        if is_integer(answer):\n            return int(answer)%1000\n        else:\n            return 0\n    except:\n        return 0\n    \n    \ndef infer(df):\n    preds = []\n    for i in tqdm(range(len(df))):\n        row = df.iloc[i]\n\n        #
